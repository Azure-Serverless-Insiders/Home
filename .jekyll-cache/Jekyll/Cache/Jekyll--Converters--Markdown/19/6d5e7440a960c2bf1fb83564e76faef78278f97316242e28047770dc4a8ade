I"¿<p>Automating the training of new ML model given code updates and/or new data with labels provided by a data scientist, can pose a challenge in the context of the dev ops or app development process due to the manual nature of data science work. One solution would be to use a training script (written by the data scientist) with the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python (Azure ML Python SDK) run with a lightweight Azure Function that sends a training script to larger compute (process managed by the dev ops professional) to train an ML model (automatically performed when new data appears). This, then, triggers the build and release of an intelligent application (managed by the app developer).</p>
