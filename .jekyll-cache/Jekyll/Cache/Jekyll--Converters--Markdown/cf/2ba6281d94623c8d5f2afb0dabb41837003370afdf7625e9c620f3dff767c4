I"×<p>In this sample you will find handful of Azure Functions comprising a Mapper and Reducer to determine the average speed of New York Yellow taxi trips, per day over all of 2017.</p>

<p>You will use Durable Functions - specifically the Fan-out/Fan-in pattern - to distribute the workload across multiple instances of the Mapper then coordinate the outputs in to the Reducer and finally return the computed values for each day.</p>

<p>The source data you will be using for this MapReduce implementation can be found here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml and contains 12 CSV files of roughly 800MB each (Yellow dataset) you need to make available in Azure Blob storage - total size is ~9.6GB.</p>
