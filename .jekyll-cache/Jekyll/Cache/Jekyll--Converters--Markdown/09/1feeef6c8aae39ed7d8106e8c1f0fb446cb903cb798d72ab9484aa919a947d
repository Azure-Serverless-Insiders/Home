I"®<p>Whether youâ€™re new or seasoned to cloud, development, and SQL, building and architecting applications in the cloud has become a required skill for many roles. We recently announced a new learning path to help developers of all skill levels learn how to create applications quickly and effectively with Azure. The new learning path is Build serverless, full stack applications in Azure.</p>

<p>In this learning path, youâ€™ll learn how to create, build, and deploy modern full stack applications in Azure leveraging the language of your choice (Python, Node.js, or .NET) and with a Vue.js frontend. Topics covered include modern database capabilities, CI/CD and DevOps, backend API development, REST, and more. Using a real-world scenario of trying to catch the bus, you will learn how to build a solution that integrates Azure SQL Database, Azure Functions, Azure Static Web Apps, Logic Apps, Visual Studio Code and GitHub Actions.</p>
