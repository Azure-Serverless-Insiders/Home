Durable Functions automatically persists function parameters, return values, and other state to durable storage to guarantee reliable execution. The default configuration for Durable Functions stores this runtime state in an Azure Storage (classic) account. However, it's possible to configure Durable Functions v2.0 and above to use an alternate durable storage provider.
