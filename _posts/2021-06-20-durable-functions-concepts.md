Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions. You can use Durable Functions for stateful orchestration of function execution. A durable function app is a solution that's made up of different Azure functions. Functions can play different roles in a durable function orchestration.


There are currently four durable function types in Azure Functions: activity, orchestrator, entity, and client. The rest of this section goes into more details about the types of functions involved in an orchestration.
